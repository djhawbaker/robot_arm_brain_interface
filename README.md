# Intelligent Robotics 1
# Robot Arm Brain Interface

This project was made as a project for Portland State University's Intelligent Robotics 1 course.
The goal was to control a couple hand movements of a robotic arm with commands from an EEG brain interface.

It utilzes the OpenBCI Ganglion EEG board, a Raspberry Pi 4, an Adafruit servo breakout board and a 3D printed InMoov robotic arm.
